# Vodka - Legacy

This is the legacy version of Vodka (previously called Whelk and RCM) which was built in C++ to run as a desktop app on Windows. Current status is that I've gotten it to compile on a Mac but it doesn't do anything. This was rewritten in Javascript but I've kept this for historical purposes.
