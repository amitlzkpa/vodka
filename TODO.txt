here's my type system:


DONE - a tag is an identifier associated with a program element

DONE - a org is a special list

DONE - an org can have children that are tagged

DONE - at evaluation time, if an expression is tagged, the evaluator will check after evaluation
to see whether the expression evaluated to an org. If it did, then the evaluator will
retrieve the child matching the tag, and evaluate that

if an expression has multiple tags, the evaluator will resolve them in the order they are specified,
and use the first one that works (note: need to think more about this because what if an obj has multiple children with the same tag, what if a nex has two of the same tag, etc)

DONE - It is not an error if the returned org doesn't have that tag (unless strict mode?)

DONE - If dereferencing the tag returns another org, the evaluator will dereference again. It will keep dereferencing until:
1. the dereferencing step stops returning orgs 2. it runs out of matching tags

types:
- the type of an integer, string, etc. is just that
- the type of a lambda is a specifier containing its return value, args, etc
- the type of an org is an unordered list of tags. an org is of a given type if it contains all the tags
  in the list
- a contract is some trustable assertion about a tag, as in "you know that something with this tag is _blank_".
  - contracts are enforced at the time the tag is assigned to the nex
  - types of contracts
    - identity contract: a tag can only be assigned to a specific object
    - equality contract: a tag can only be assigned to an object that evaluates as equal to a given value
    - simple type contract: something with tag Foo must be an integer
    - lambda exclusive type contract: something with tag Foo must be a lambda with the exact type string -# arg# arg#
    - lambda inclusive type contract: something with tag Foo must be a lambda that could allow arguments that match a given type string
    - list exclusive tag contents contract: something with tag Foo must be an list containing things with
      tags Foo, Bar, and Baz and nothing else (note: it doesn't have to be an org, but if it's not an org,
      it can't be dereferenced)
    - list inclusive tag contents contract: something with tag Foo must be an list containing things with tags
      Foo, Bar, and Baz, but it could have other things
    - list exclusive type contents contract: something with tag Foo must be a list with two integers and nothing else (or whatever)
    - list inclusive type contents contract: something with tag Foo must be a list with at least two integers, could have other things
    - something with tag Foo must also have tags Bar, Baz, and Qux (this is how you do 'contract contract', i.e. enforce
      that a nex satisfies multiple contracts)
    - custom contract: you implement a function in Vodka that returns true or false, and at contract-check time
      the framework evaluates your function, passing in the nex that is being checked for whether it satisfies the contract
      

contracts are only checked at tag assignment time for performance reasons, but there can be a primitive that
re-checks contracts



- a kind is an restriction that states that a given tag can only be assigned to something with a given type
- lambda type strings can also include tags, which indicate that the thing passed in must have that tag

examples of lambda type strings:

arg1 arg2
    two args of any type

arg1# arg2#
    two integers

arg1! arg2!
    two booleans

arg1& arg2&
    two lambdas

arg1* arg2*
    two expectations

arg1@ arg2@
    two symbols

_arg1@ arg2@
    two symbols, but the first one is not evaluated before being passed

arg1% arg2#...
    a float and then zero or more integers (variadic argument)

arg1% arg2#?
    a float and then an optional integer

_arg1~ arg2~
    two commands - the first is unevaluated, but the second needs to be returned by
    the evaluation step for the second argument

arg1( arg2(
    two lists

arg1#[Magnitude] arg2#
    two integers, but the first one has to be tagged with 'Magnitude'

arg1) arg2)
    two orgs, any type

arg1)[Magnitude] arg2)
    two orgs, but the first one has to be tagged with 'Magnitude'

-# arg1#
    this function takes an integer and returns an integer

-)[Magnitude] arg1#
    this function takes an integer and returns an obj tagged with 'Magnitude'




experimental features regarding return values:

- setting '-' would set the return value
-#?
    this function can return an integer but it can also return 'nothing', which means
    the evaluator removes whatever it returned from the arg list of what it was in.
-#...
    this function can return more than one thing
_-
    this function is not evaluated, e.g. so if you had:
    (~bind @do-not-do (&_-# (~+ #3 #3)))
    we have a function that adds 3 + 3 and returns an integer, but it's not evaluated.
    this means that if you have this:
    (~+ #9 (~do-not-do))
    it fails because the (~do-not-do) is basically treated like it's been quoted, but this:
    (~+ #9 (~eval (~do-not-do)))
    would work fine because "skip eval" only applies to the first time basically:
    that is to say, if a "do not eval" function is evaluated, it loses its "do not eval" status.


- make it so that anything inside braces in a tag, i.e. [] is ignored (use this for comments?)



TESTS = crucial
- test for equal
- some tests for object tags
- copy and paste tests (same as 2?)
- tests for run-js
- tests for cram and chop
- test for to-word
- tests for all async primitives
- go over all checkins over the past month and figure out what tests are missing
- need test for partial-exploded mode ,it doesn't work because esc is integral to my test recording framework
- I should have a test for each type of error location to make sure error propagation doesn't get broken. so basically any place that evaluateNexSafely is called
- test for to-float
- tests for catch, eval


BUGFIXES = necessary
- fix bug where you can eval a symbol and then change code that is being executed async by an expectation
- fix problem with the set-style function where it creates an infinite loop of expectations
- make it impossible for wrap-expectation to go on forever.
- step eval is mostly broken, fix (FOR STEP EVAL FIXES SEE CODE CLEANUP SECTION)
- executing a subexpression when you're in the middle of step evaluating is broken: specifically::: execution_stepeval_bindwithnormal is broken because somehow when you are step evaluating and you click on a subexpression with bound environment and you normal-eval it, if you click on the result of that inner normal-eval inside its expectation, and shift-tab to go to the parent YOU DON'T GO ANYWHERE. why.  (FOR STEP EVAL FIXES SEE CODE CLEANUP SECTION)
- trying to load a file that doesn't exist crashes the server
- saving a file with an error in it only saves the top-level error not the enclosed errors.


CODE CLEANUP = good
- make a better naming convention for js global variables decide what's a const and what's a singleton and generally what's what.
- update ILVL (it's been renamed to stackLevel) in step eval
- come up with a better naming convention for global objects
- handle insertion points at the render node level
- get rid of that carriage return object and use insertion point for that
- rename getFulfilledThing to fulfill
- use regexes in the event table to clean up the event tables
- remove old edit primitive
- fix render node hacks in estring class coming from the normal/expanded drawing logic
- remove dead code from eerror class because it can't be drawn in expanded mode anymore
- figure out what to do in run-js if no DOM object (throw exception? create one?)
- change the step eval stuff so that alt-enter changes the selected item rather than maintaining a stack (NOTE: this is probably better to do than fix any of the existing step eval stuff)
- remove makeCopy/js array hack in Environment.lb
- BuiltinParamManager and BuiltinArgEvaluator do the same thing, merge somehow


PERFORMANCE FIXES = recommended
- use "dirty-only" rendering everywhere it is possible to use it
- instanceof checks are slow, for nexes instead compare to getTypeName()


USABILITY IMPROVEMENTS = nice to have
- rename *-functions files to *-library
- rename library functions so that the library name is in the function name - OR implement a package grouping system of some kind
- make it so you can specify arg type with the codes I use in the builtin param names, and that you can have them in lambdas.
- tags precede rather than follow content
- start using exclamation points for primitives that set values like in regular lisp, like apply-style-to


NEW FEATURES = be careful
- short circuit evaluation for conditionals
- make it so you can change exploded/normal in code by setting a tag
- make a tag type that is sort of an enum (like radio buttons)
- make a "toggle" tag type (like a form checkbox)
- make the thing that changes error types use tags to designate the desired error type
- make a list type that is just "list" that can be vert/horiz, looks like a command or lambda but without the symbol, and which, when you evaluate it, replaces each of its children with the result of evaluating that child
- backtick does operations on tags
- implement to-word for lines and docs
- implement "equal" for list types (needs to be deep equal)
- make native primitives for some common operations that could be bootstrapped (like iteration)
- make "type creation" primitives (make-integer, make-float, etc)
- make the ff primitives use "skip eval" but test arguments to see if they are
  already expectations and if so just use, otherwise eval argument.


EXPERIMENTS TO TRY = be extra careful
- get rid of insertion points and switch to pre- and post- inserts
- try voice commands
- make arithmetic functions use plus, minus words instead of symbols
- make docs so that !#$ characters add those literal characters and the only ones that work are ~@
- use a different key for modifying string contents rather than shift-enter
- try having different ctrl/alt/shift chords for insert/append/prepend/enclose versions of !@#$
