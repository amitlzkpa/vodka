# Vodka - Legacy

This is the legacy version of Vodka (previously called Whelk and RCM) which was built (primarily between 2003-2005) in C++ to run as a desktop app first in Linux, then in Windows. In 2019 I got it to compile on a Mac but that's it, it doesn't do anything right now. This was rewritten in Javascript (see the main trunk) but I've kept this original code for historical purposes.
